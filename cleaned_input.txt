Prevent Young Children From Drowning:
Install fencing or approved barrier around all sides of pool. State or local laws or codes may require fencing or other approved barriers.
Check state or local laws and codes before setting up pool. Drowning occurs silently and quickly. Assign an adult to supervise pool and wear
provided water watcher tag.
Keep children in your direct sight when they are in or near pool and when you are filling and emptying pool.
When searching for a missing child, check pool first, even if you think your child is in the house.
Pool presents a drowning hazard even during filling and draining of the pool. Maintain constant supervision of children and do not remove any
safety barriers until the pool is completely empty and stowed away.
Refer to the list of barrier recommendations and guidelines as described in CPSC Publication No.362.
Assign an adult to be responsible for watching children in the pool. Give this person a “water watcher” tag and ask that they wear it the entire time
they are in charge of supervising children in the pool. If they need to leave for any reason, ask this person to pass the “water watcher” tag and the
supervision responsibility to another adult.
Locate pumps and filters in such a way that children cannot climb on them to gain access to pool.
Prevent Young Children From Gaining Access to Pool:
Remove pool ladders before leaving pool. Toddlers can climb ladder and get into pool.
Position furniture away from pool so that children cannot climb and gain access to pool.
When leaving pool, remove floats and toys from pool that might attract a child.
Be Prepared to Respond to an Emergency:
Keep a working phone and list of emergency numbers near pool. Become certified in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) so you can respond to
an emergency.
Electrocution Risk:
Keep all electrical lines, radios, speakers, and other electrical devices away from pool.

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
CHOOSE THE CORRECT LOCATION
The surface chosen to install the pool on must respect the following conditions:
• Because of the combined weight of the water inside the pool and the pool users, it is extremely important that the surface chosen to install the
pool on is capable of uniformly supporting the total weight for the entire time the pool is installed. When choosing the surface, take into
consideration that water may come out of the pool when in use or when it rains. If the water softens the surface, it may lose its capability to
support the pool weight.
• Check the position of the vertical legs and/or the U-supports regularly. They must be on the same level as the bottom of the pool at all times. If the
vertical leg or the U-support starts to sink into the ground, drain the pool water immediately to avoid the pool collapsing due to the uneven loading
on the frame structure. Change the location of the pool or modify the surface material.
• The surface must be flat and smooth. If the surface is inclined or uneven, it can create an unbalanced loading on the structure of the pool. This
can damage the welding points of the liner and bend the frame. In the worst cases, the pool can collapse, causing serious personal injury and/or
damage to personal property.
• We recommend positioning the pool away from any objects children could use to climb into the pool.
• Position the pool near an adequate drainage system to deal with overflow or to empty the pool. Ensure the pool side with the water inlet A and
outlet B is located in the same direction of the power source, where the filtration system has to be connected.
• The selected surface must be clear of any type of object. Due to the weight of the water, any object under the pool could damage or perforate the
bottom of the pool.
• The selected surface must be clear of aggressive plants and weed species. Those types of strong vegetation could grow through the liner and
create water leakage. Grass or other vegetation that may cause odor or slime to develop have to be eliminated from the set-up location.
• The selected location must not have overhead power lines or trees. Be sure the location does not contain underground utility pipes, lines or
cables of any kind.
• The selected position must be far from house entrance. Do not position any equipment or other furniture around the pool. The water that comes
out of the pool during use or due to product faults can damage furniture inside the house or surrounding the pool.
• The selected surface must be flat and without holes that can damage the material of the liner.
• Keep at least 1.5 meters around the pool free of walls, fences or other structures to avoid damaging to the pool during use.
Suggested set-up surfaces: grass, ground, concrete, and all other surfaces that respect the above set-up conditions.
Surfaces to avoid: mud, sand, gravel, deck, balcony, driveway, platform, soft/loose soil or other surface that does not meet the above set-up
conditions.
• Check with your local city council for by-laws relating to fencing, barriers, lighting and safety requirements and ensure you comply with all laws.
• If a pump and/or ladder is included in the set, refer to the pump's and/or ladder's manual for safety instructions and installation. The ladder must
match the pool size.
• If during set up it is necessary to change the position of the pool, lift up the liner and do not drag it on the ground; the friction between the PVC
material and the ground can damage the pool liner.
• Follow the important instructions above to choose the correct surface and location to set up your pool. Damaged parts of the pool, due
to the fact that the set-up surface and location does not match the instructions, will not be considered as manufacture defect and will
avoid the warranty and any service claims.
Assembly Instructions
For installation instructions, scan the QR Code printed on the front cover or follow the illustrations below. Drawings are for illustration purposes only.
May not reflect actual product. Not to scale. Assembly of this pool can be completed without additional tools. Bestway is not responsible for
damage caused to the pool due to mishandling or failure to follow these instructions.
Helpful Installation Tips:
We strongly suggest opening the package and assembling the pool when the ambient temperature is above 59ºF / 15ºC. The PVC material of the
liner will be more flexible and easier to assemble in this environment. To expedite the assembly process, we suggest setting the pool up with the
help of 2-3 people.
We suggest you buy a pool ladder (if one is not included in the set) and prepare it before setting up the pool, as it will help whenever you need to
get inside it.
Filling the Pool with Water:
ATTENTION: Do not leave the pool unattended while filling with water. Check the pool situation by time during this operation. Be sure that the
position of the vertical legs is not under the liner and is 90 degrees to the surface.
It is highly recommended to use tap water for filling to minimize unwanted content, such as minerals. Do not use sea water. Fill the pool with water
after all assembly steps are completed and until the water reaches the welding line, which corresponds to 90% of the full capacity. Do not overfill as
this could cause the pool to collapse. In the case of heavy rainfall, we strongly recommend reducing the water level to keep it at 90% capacity and
avoid the overflow of water.
IMPORTANT: When the pool is 90% full, check that the distance between the water surface and the top of the rails is the same all around. If it is
different, it means that the surface is not level, and we strongly recommend draining the water and adjusting the chosen location. Never attempt to
move the pool with water still in it.
IMPORTANT: Keeping the pool full of water on unlevel ground can cause the bursting of welding points and/or pool collapse, causing serious
personal injury and/or damage to property. Your pool may contain a great deal of pressure. If your pool has a bulge or uneven side, the sides may
burst, suddenly releasing water and causing serious personal injury and/or damage to property. When the pool is 90% full, check the pool for any
leaks at the valves or seams and for any evident water loss. Do not add any chemicals to the water until this has been done.

When the pool is filled with around 0.39 in. (1 cm) of water, gently smooth out the bottom liner to remove all folds. We recommend starting
from the center of the pool and continuing outwards. You can continue to fill the pool when the floor is smooth and wrinkle-free.

If the connection valve for the pool's inlet A is composed of Part H and Part G:
1. Unscrew the gear from Part G.
2. Insert the smaller end of Part G through the inlet from the inside of the pool.
3. Tighten the gear from the outside of the pool to attach Part G to the liner.
4. Screw Part H onto Part G and close the water valve in the locked position to complete the connection.

IMPORTANT: Check the position of the vertical legs at
times while filling the pool with water. The legs can
gradually change position due to increased water weight.
If the legs are not perpendicular to the ground, please
stop filling the pool and adjust them. It will help with
weight distribution to avoid strain on the frame and liner.
MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS
If you do not adhere to the maintenance guidelines below, your health might be at risk, especially that of your children.
WATER
• Keeping your pool water clean and chemically balanced is necessary. Simply cleaning the filter cartridge is not enough for proper maintenance;
we recommend you use pool chemicals to maintain water chemistry and chlorine or bromine tablets (do not use granules) with the chemical
dispenser.
• Water quality is directly related to frequency of use, number of users and overall maintenance of the pool. The water should be changed every 3
days if there is no chemical treatment being performed with the water. It is highly recommended to use tap water for filling to minimize the
influence of unwanted content, such as minerals.
• We recommend that you take a shower before using your pool, as cosmetic products, lotions, and other residues on the skin can quickly degrade
water quality.
• Skim pool regularly to avoid settled dirt.
• Locate a bucket of water next to pool to clean users’ feet before entering pool.
• The chemical maintenance must be performed with ChemConnect or chemical floater; don't throw chemical products directly in the water, the
chemical will deposit on the bottom and damage the material and discolor the PVC.
Chemical Tablets (Not Included):
• Your purchased pool set may not include any dispensers; in this case you can purchase one by visiting our website www.bestwayusa.com or at
the nearest pool dealer.
• Remove the chemical dispenser from pool when the pool is in use.
• After performing chemical maintenance and before using the pool, use a test kit (not included) to test the water chemistry. We recommend
maintaining your water chemical balance as shown in the below table.
TEST IDEAL VALUES
pH value 7.4 – 7.6
Cyanuric acid 30 – 50 ppm
Free chlorine 2 – 4 ppm
Chlorine compound 0
Algae None visible
Calcium hardness 200 – 400 ppm
• Pool damage resulting from misuse of chemicals and mismanagement of pool water is not covered by the warranty.
• Over usage of chemicals will discolor the printing and all points of the pool material; in worst cases, it will damage the structure of the pool liner.
• Pool chemicals are potentially toxic and should be handled with care. There are serious health risks from chemical vapors and the incorrect
labeling and storage of chemical containers.
• Please consult your local pool or chemical supply retailer for more information about chemical maintenance. Pay close attention to the chemical
manufacturer’s instructions.
• The pump is used to circulate the water and to filter small particles. In order to keep your pool water clean and hygienic, you must also add
chemicals.
LINER
• We suggested that you buy a pool cover, if not included in the set, and cover the pool when not in use, to prevent any damage to the Duraplus
material on the top rails. Gently clean any dirt deposit on the top rails with a clean cloth.
• Before attaching the pool cover, ensure the water is at the maximum level. If the water level is too low, the pool cover should not be installed.

DRAINING
• For draining, follow the drawings inside the manual. Drawings are for illustration purposes only. May not reflect actual product. Not to scale.
• To drain your pool water, check local regulations for drainage by-laws.
CLEANING
• Rinse the pool liner with tap water, to remove any residual of chemicals or dirt completely.
• Leave the pool under the sunlight until it's completely dried.
• To remove the remaining water completely, wipe the pool liner with a dry cloth.
STORAGE
• Remove all accessories; be sure that pool liner and accessories are completely clean and dry before the storage. If the pool is not completely dry,
mold may result and will damage the pool liner during the storage period.
• Once pool is completely dry, sprinkle with talcum powder to prevent pool from sticking together.
• We strongly recommend disassembling the pool when the environment temperature is below 10ºC / 50ºF.
• Fold the pool liner only if the environment temperature is above 10ºC / 50ºF. Store the pool in a dry place with a moderate temperature between
10ºC / 50ºF and 38ºC / 100ºF and position the pool liner and all accessories inside a carton box, to better protect the PVC material during the
winter period.
