# üß† CognitiveLattice: Intelligent AI Agent Framework

**CognitiveLattice** is a sophisticated AI agent framework that combines **intelligent tool orchestration**, **persistent memory**, and **context-aware processing** to create truly adaptive and capable AI assistants.

Rather than being just another LLM wrapper, CognitiveLattice implements a **cognitive architecture** that enables AI agents to:
- Remember where they've been, what they're doing, and where they're going
- Intelligently select and coordinate tools based on context
- **Execute autonomous web automation with intelligent planning**
- Maintain persistent session memory across interactions
- Process documents with enhanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Execute complex multi-step tasks with adaptive planning

## üé¨ Live Demo
Watch the CognitiveLattice agent in action. This is not a scripted demo. It's a live demonstration of the Cognitive Lattice enabling a series of stateless API calls to be chained into a single, successful, multi-step task. The agent's ability to select the right tool and recall its own actions is entirely dynamic.

## üåü Key Features

### üß† **Cognitive Lattice** - Persistent Memory & Session Management
- **Hybrid State Management**: Active task tracking + comprehensive event logging
- **Cross-Session Persistence**: Session files can be loaded/resumed (user-selectable lattice loading coming soon)
- **Dynamic Context Extraction**: Automatically builds relevant context from session history
- **Task Progress Tracking**: Monitors multi-step task completion with step-by-step state
- **Model-Agnostic Memory**: Lattice data works with any LLM - switch models without losing context

### üîß **Intelligent Tool Management**
- **LLM-Driven Tool Selection**: Uses AI reasoning to choose appropriate tools
- **Generic Tool Architecture**: Works with any tool, not hardcoded for specific domains
- **Contextual Parameter Extraction**: Automatically extracts tool parameters from conversation
- **Tool Result Integration**: Seamlessly integrates tool outputs into conversations

### üìã **Structured Task Execution** *(Production Ready)*
- **Multi-Step Planning**: Creates and executes complex task plans

- **OpenAI Integration**: Leverages GPT models for enhanced reasoning
- **Modular API Client**: Easy to extend with other AI services
- **Error Handling & Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation when external services unavailable
- **Token-Conscious Processing**: Optimizes token usage while maintaining capability

### üîí **Privacy & Security Architecture (Airgap Design)**
- **Document Airgapping**: Process documents locally without exposing content to external LLMs
- **Encryption-Ready**: Built-in encoding/decoding system supports encrypted document transmission
- **Lattice Confidentiality**: Session data can be encrypted before storage (implementation pending)
- **Model Independence**: Switch between LLMs without exposing previous reasoning or context
- **Future-Proof Privacy**: Maintains user confidentiality as AI models evolve
